# Extended-Euclidean-Algorithm
Extended Euclidean Algorithm says that if `d = gcd(a,b), then d can be computed, and there exists x,y s.t. ax+by = d`. Ruby implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

## Run
`ruby EEA.rb arg1, arg2` will apply EEA on two numbers.

Requires installation of Ruby.
